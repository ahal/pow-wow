This is a little native events c library that can be called from JS using
JS ctypes.  In order to build the library, you need to install
scons: http://www.scons.org/doc/production/HTML/scons-user.html#chap-build-install

Then, in this directory type:
scons

This is obviously, still under construction.  More info to come.
